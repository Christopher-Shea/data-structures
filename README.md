# Data Structures
This is a project I completed while a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

My partner and I implemented the follwing common data structures and associated methods:
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists (singly and doubly-linked)
- Trees (+BSTs)
- Hash Tables

We also gained experience using a variety of instantiation patterns in JavaScript (e.g. functional, prototypal - including ES6 classes)
